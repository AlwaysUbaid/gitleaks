### Option 2: Python Script
```bash
cd /Users/ubaid/gitleaks
python3 scan_repos.py
```

## Output

The scripts will:

1. **Clone each repository** to a temporary directory
2. **Scan for secrets** using gitleaks
3. **Generate detailed reports** in JSON format
4. **Provide a summary** of findings
5. **Create a final report** with all results

### Sample Output

```
üîç Gitleaks Repository Scanner
================================
Scanning 6 repositories for secrets...

üìÅ Scanning: AlgoHL
‚úÖ Clean: AlgoHL (no secrets found)

üìÅ Scanning: hummingbot-ubaid
üö® SECRETS FOUND: hummingbot-ubaid (3 findings)
   üìÑ Report saved to: /tmp/gitleaks_scan_xxx/hummingbot-ubaid_gitleaks_report.json
   üîç Findings summary:
   ‚Ä¢ aws-access-key: AWS Access Key (File: config.py, Line: 15)
   ‚Ä¢ github-pat: GitHub Personal Access Token (File: .env, Line: 3)
   ‚Ä¢ generic-api-key: Generic API Key (File: secrets.json, Line: 8)

üìä SCAN SUMMARY
===============
Total Repositories: 6
Successfully Scanned: 6
Repositories with Secrets: 1
Total Secret Findings: 3
```

## Understanding Results

### Clean Repository ‚úÖ
- No secrets detected
- Repository is safe

### Secrets Found üö®
- **Immediate Action Required**:
  1. Review the detailed JSON report
  2. Determine if findings are real secrets or false positives
  3. If real secrets are found:
     - **Rotate/revoke** the compromised credentials immediately
     - **Remove secrets** from git history
     - **Update** your secrets management practices

## Report Files

After scanning, you'll find:

- `{repo_name}_gitleaks_report.json` - Detailed findings for each repo
- `final_report.txt` - Summary report
- All files are saved in a temporary directory

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit real secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Implement pre-commit hooks** with gitleaks
4. **Regular scanning** of repositories
5. **Rotate credentials** if secrets are found

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"gitleaks not found"**
   - Install gitleaks: `brew install gitleaks`

2. **"jq not found"** (bash script only)
   - Install jq: `brew install jq`

3. **"Permission denied" cloning repos**
   - Ensure you have access to the repositories
   - Check your GitHub authentication

4. **Timeout errors**
   - Large repositories may take time to clone
   - Check your internet connection

### Getting Help

- Check gitleaks documentation: https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks
- Review the generated JSON reports for detailed findings
- Consider running gitleaks manually on individual repos for debugging

## Next Steps

After running the scan:

1. **Review all findings** carefully
2. **Take immediate action** on any real secrets found
3. **Set up prevention** measures:
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - CI/CD integration
   - Regular scanning schedule
4. **Update your workflow** to prevent future secret commits

**Remember**: Security is an ongoing process. Regular scanning and good practices are essential for maintaining repository security.
